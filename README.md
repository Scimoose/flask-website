# flask-website
Static website made for a biotech conference with flask backend.

Deployed in 2019 originally without Flask, was remade to practice working with Flask. The website was made for a biotech conference held in my university (Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences) named "Krok w Przyszłość" ("A step into the future"). Uses Bootstrap, Flask and features google maps.
